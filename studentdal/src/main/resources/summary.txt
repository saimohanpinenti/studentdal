student project 

student model class , REPosiotry of stundent, using JPA.

here in this studentdal project we are going to create a data base of student with fields inside it and then create a data access layer in springboot.
 with the spring starter project with the dependencies of mysql and JPA at starting only .
 
 Create a student class with the parameters inside it and the mark the student class with @Entity annotation.
 the tabel name in the repository was differnt from the name of the student class in the entities package. we use @Table(name = "studenttab") annotation where in the double quotes we mention the name of the studenttab data base name . 
 
 we also used
 @Id: annotation for mentioning that this field is a primary key,
 eg:
 @Id
	private Long id;
 @Column(name ="sname") : we used this annotation to each field which is having differnt name in the data base. 
 eg: 
 @Column(name = "sfee")
	private Double fee;
	
	
	create a repo called StudentRepos which is actually a Interface which will extend the CrudRepository<Student, Long> interface where student is the model which we creared and Long is the data type of primary key id which we used in the Student model class 

since the Id which is primarykey which will be autogenerated by data base we need to annotate with @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO). which tells that
the Id is a autogenerated value by database.
eg:
@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
private Long id;	

In the application.properties we will add the required configurtion

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/projectdb
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=1234

spring.jpa.show-sql=true  : this is for showing the sql statements in console and other three in top are for connection
